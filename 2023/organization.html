                            <li><b>Yoav Artzi</b> is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Cornell Tech at Cornell University. 
							His research focuses on developing learning methods for natural language understanding and generation in automated interactive systems. 
							He received an NSF CAREER award, and his work was acknowledged by awards and honorable mentions at ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and IROS. 
							Yoav holds a B.Sc. from Tel Aviv University and a Ph.D. from the University of Washington.</li>
                            <li><b>Kianté Brantley</b> s a Postdoctoral scholar at Cornell working with Thorsten Joachims. 
							He completed his Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Maryland College Park (UMD) advised by Professor Hal Daumé III. 
							Brantley designs algorithms that efficiently integrate domain knowledge into sequential decision-making problems. </li>
                            <li><b>Soham Dan</b> is a Research Scientist at IBM. He completed his Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Dan Roth. 
							His research focuses on natural language understanding, specifically for instruction following tasks. 
							He is interested in interactive learning, compositional generalization, neuro-symbolic algorithms, and robust learning from limited supervision.</li>
							<li><b>Ji-Ung Lee</b> is a PhD student at the Technical University of Darmstadt. 
							His research focuses on effective model training from user feedback in low-data scenarios coupled with providing the user with instances that fit their needs.</li>
                            <li><b>Khanh Nguyen</b> is a postdoc researcher at Princeton University. He received a PhD in Computer Science at the University
							of Maryland–College Park. His research focuses on building agents that can communicate naturally and effectively with humans to better assist them. </li>
                            <li><b>Edwin Simpson</b> is a lecturer at the University of Bristol working on interactive
							learning for NLP and machine learning for crowdsourced annotation with an interest in
							Bayesian methods for handling uncertainty.</li>
