                        <h1>Organizing Committee (in alphabetical order)</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Yoav Artzi</b> is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and
                                Cornell Tech at Cornell University. He holds a B.Sc. from Tel Aviv University and a
                                Ph.D.from the University of Washington. Along his academic work, he conducts research at
                                ASAPP. He studies methods for natural language understanding and generation in automated,
                                situated systems. His research goals are: (a) to build computer systems that interact
                                with users using natural language and continuously improve through interaction, and (b)
                                to develop computational understanding of natural language as a communication system.
                                A core principle underlying his current work is that learning,production, and
                                comprehension of natural language does not occur in isolation, but within dynamic
                                interactions with other intentional agents situated in a shared environment.</li>
                            <li><b>Kianté Brantley</b> is a Postdoctoral scholar at Cornell working with Thorsten
                                Joachims. He complete his Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Maryland
                                College Park (UMD) advised by Professor Hal Daumé III. Brantley designs algorithms that
                                efficiently integrate domain knowledge into sequential decision-making problems. He is
                                most excited about imitation learning and interactive learning or, more broadly,
                                settings that involve a feedback loop between a machine learning agent and the input
                                the machine learning agent sees. </li>
                            <li><b>Soham Dan</b>  is a final-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, advised
                                by Dan Roth. His research focuses on natural language understanding, specifically, in
                                the context of grounded domains. He is interested in a number of topics related to
                                grounded instruction following: concept learning, compositional generalization,
                                interactive learning, semantic parsing, and robust learning from weak supervision.</li>
                            <li><b>Khanh Nguyen</b> is a postdoc researcher at Princeton University. He received a PhD in Computer Science at the University
                                of Maryland–College Park. His research focuses on building agents that can
                                communicate naturally and effectively with humans to better assist them. </li>
                            <li><b>Ji-Ung Lee</b> is a PhD student at the Technical University of Darmstadt. His
                                research focuses on effective model training from user feedback in low-data scenarios
                                coupled with providing the user with instances that fit their needs.</li>
                            <li><b>Edwin Simpson</b> is a lecturer at the University of Bristol working on interactive
                                learning for NLP and machine learning for crowdsourced annotation with an interest in
                                Bayesian methods for handling uncertainty.</li>
                            <li><b>Alane Suhr</b> is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell
                                University. Her research spans natural language processing, machine learning, and
                                computer vision, with a focus on building systems that participate and continually learn
                                in situated natural language interactions with human users.</li>
