                        <h1>Motivation</h1>
                        <p>A key aspect of human learning is the ability to learn continuously from various sources of
                            feedback. In contrast, much of the recent success of deep learning for NLP relies on large
                            datasets and extensive compute resources to train and fine-tune models, which then remain
                            fixed. This leaves a research gap for systems that adapt to the changing needs of individual
                            users or allow users to continually correct errors as they emerge. Learning from user
                            interaction  is crucial for tasks that require a high grade of personalization and for
                            rapidly changing or complex, multi-step tasks where collecting and annotating large datasets
                            is not feasible, but an informed user can provide guidance.</p>

                        <h1>What is interactive NLP?</h1>
                        <p>Interactive Learning for NLP means training, fine-tuning or otherwise adapting an NLP model
                            to inputs from a human user or teacher. Relevant approaches range from active learning with
                            a human in the loop, to training with implicit user feedback (e.g. clicks), dialogue systems
                            that adapt to user utterances, and training with new forms of human input. Interactive
                            learning is the converse of  learning from datasets collected offline with no human input
                            during the training process.</p>

                        <h1>Goals</h1>
                        <p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Develop <i>novel methods for interactive machine learning</i> of NLP models.</li>
                            <li>Discuss how to <i>evaluate</i> interactive NLP systems, including models for realistic user simulation.</li>
                            <li><i>Identify scenarios</i> involving natural language where interactive learning is beneficial.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Previous work has been split across different tracks and task-focused workshops, making it
                            hard to disentangle applications from broadly-applicable methodologies or establish common
                            practices for evaluating interactive learning systems. We aim to bring together researchers
                            to share insights on interactive learning from a wide range of NLP-related fields, including,
                            but not limited to, dialogue systems, question answering, summarization, and educational
                            applications.</p>
                        <p>Concerning <i>methodology</i>, we encourage submissions investigating various dimensions of
                            interactive learning, such as (but not restricted to):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Interactive machine learning methods: the wide range of topics discussed above, from
                                active learning with a user to methods that extract, interpret and aggregate user
                                feedback or preferences from complex interactions, such as natural language instructions.</li>
                            <li>User effort:  the amount of user effort required for different types of feedback;
                                explicit labels require higher user effort than feedback deduced from user interaction
                                (e.g., clicks, viewtime); how users cope with the system misinterpreting instructions.</li>
                            <li>Feedback types: different types of feedback require different techniques to incorporate
                                them into a model. E.g., explicit labels allow us to directly train while user
                                instructions require interpretation. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A major bottleneck for interactive learning approaches is their <i>evaluation</i>, including
                            a lack of suitable datasets. We therefore encourage submissions that cover research into the
                            following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Evaluation methods: approaches to assessing interactive methods, such as low-effort,
                                easily reproducible approaches with real-world users and simulated user models for
                                automated evaluation.</li>
                            <li>Reproducibility: procedures for documenting user evaluations and ensuring they are
                                reproducible.</li>
                            <li>Data: Introduce novel datasets for training and evaluating interactive models. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To investigate <i>scenarios</i> where interactive learning is effective, we invite submissions that
                            present empirical results for applications of interactive methods.</p>
